<h2>About this list</h2>
<strong>How do I put this list together?</strong>

It’s largely automated. I have a collection of Python scripts in a Jupyter Notebook that scrapes Meetup and Eventbrite for events in categories that I consider to be “tech,” “entrepreneur,” and “nerd.” The result is a checklist that I review. I make judgment calls and uncheck any items that I don’t think fit on this list.

In addition to events that my scripts find, I also manually add events when their organizers contact me with their details.

<strong>What goes into this list?</strong>

I prefer to cast a wide net, so the list includes events that would be of interest to techies, nerds, and entrepreneurs. It includes (but isn’t limited to) events that fall under any of these categories:
<ul>
 	<li>
<ul>
 	<li>Programming, DevOps, systems administration, and testing</li>
 	<li>Tech project management / agile processes</li>
 	<li>Video, board, and role-playing games</li>
 	<li>Book, philosophy, and discussion clubs</li>
 	<li>Tech, business, and entrepreneur networking events</li>
 	<li>Toastmasters and other events related to improving your presentation and public speaking skills, because nerds really need to up their presentation game</li>
 	<li>Sci-fi, fantasy, and other genre fandoms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Self-improvement, especially of the sort that appeals to techies</li>
 	<li>Anything I deem geeky</li>
</ul>
